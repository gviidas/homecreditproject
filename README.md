## Home Credit Risk Assessment Project

### Introduction

This project aims to apply advanced machine learning techniques for the prediction of high-risk loans, utilizing comprehensive datasets provided by the Home Credit.

### Table of Contents

1. **Data Aggregation**: This section focuses on the extraction of relevant information from multiple databases to construct a robust dataset for modeling.
  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: A thorough statistical analysis accompanied by data visualizations is conducted to understand the underlying patterns and correlations within the data.

3. **Data Cleaning**: A critical pre-processing step that involves the identification and treatment of missing values, outliers, and other data irregularities.

4. **Feature Engineering**: The creation of new variables derived from the existing data to enhance the predictive power of the machine learning models.

5. **Predicting Target Groups**: Application of machine learning algorithms to identify loan applicants who are likely to be high-risk.

6. **Model Deployment**: The top-performing model was deployed on the Google Cloud Platform.

7. **Summary and Further Improvements**: An overview of the project outcomes, acknowledgments of its limitations, and discussions on potential enhancements for future iterations.
